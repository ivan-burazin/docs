- **File Operations**: Comprehensive file system manipulation capabilities
- **Process Execution**: Run code and commands in isolated environments
- **Git Integration**: Clone repositories and manage version control
- **LSP Support**: Language Server Protocol integration for code intelligence
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for both Python and TypeScript

## Quick Example

```python
from daytona_sdk import Daytona
from daytona_sdk.daytona import CreateWorkspaceParams

# Initialize the SDK
daytona = Daytona()

# Create a workspace
params = CreateWorkspaceParams(
    language='python',
    image='ai-test:1'
)
workspace = daytona.create(params)

# Run some code
response = workspace.process.code_run('print("Hello from Daytona!")')
print(response.result)

# Clean up
daytona.remove(workspace)
```
