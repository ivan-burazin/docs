description: Learn how to manage files and directories in your Daytona workspace.
---

The Daytona SDK provides comprehensive file system operations for managing files and directories in your workspace.

## Basic Operations

### Listing Files

```python
# List files in a directory
files = workspace.fs.list_files('/project')
for file in files:
    print(f"Name: {file.name}, Type: {file.type}")
```

### Creating Directories

```python
# Create a new directory
workspace.fs.create_folder('/project/src', '755')  # With permissions
```

### Uploading Files

```python
# Upload a file with content
content = """
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
"""
workspace.fs.upload_file('/project/src/main.py', content)
```

### Downloading Files

```python
# Read file content
content = workspace.fs.download_file('/project/src/main.py')
print(content)
```

## Advanced Operations

### Finding Files

```python
# Search for files
matches = workspace.fs.find_files('/project', '*.py')
for match in matches:
    print(f"Found Python file: {match}")
```

### Modifying Files

```python
# Replace content in files
workspace.fs.replace_in_files(
    ['/project/src/main.py'],
    'Hello, World',
    'Hello, Daytona'
)
```

### File Permissions

```python
# Set file permissions
workspace.fs.chmod('/project/script.sh', '755')
```

## Best Practices

1. Use proper error handling:

```python
try:
    workspace.fs.upload_file('/path/to/file', content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to upload file: {e}")
```

2. Clean up temporary files:

```python
try:
    # Your file operations
    workspace.fs.upload_file('/tmp/temp.txt', 'temporary content')
    # Process the file
finally:
    # Clean up
    workspace.fs.remove('/tmp/temp.txt')
```

3. Use appropriate permissions:

```python
# Create directory with specific permissions
workspace.fs.create_folder('/project/bin', '755')  # Executable
workspace.fs.create_folder('/project/data', '644')  # Regular files
```
