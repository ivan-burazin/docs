## Version Format

The Daytona API uses a simple major version number in the URL path. The current version is `v1`.

```bash
https://api.daytona.io/v1/
```

## API Stability

We maintain strict backwards compatibility within a major version. Any breaking changes will be introduced in a new major version, and we'll provide ample notice before deprecating old versions.

### What We Consider Breaking Changes

- Removing or renaming API endpoints
- Removing or renaming required request parameters
- Adding new required request parameters
- Changing response formats in incompatible ways
- Changing authentication methods

### Non-Breaking Changes

- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional request parameters
- Adding new properties to response objects
- Adding new error codes
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes

## Version Lifecycle

1. **Active Development**: Latest version with new features
2. **Stable**: Current recommended version
3. **Maintenance**: Security updates only
4. **Deprecated**: Set for removal
5. **Sunset**: No longer available

## Version Support

- We support each major version for a minimum of 12 months after a new version is released
- Security fixes are backported to all supported versions
- When a version is deprecated, we provide migration guides to newer versions

## Version Headers

You can optionally include the `Accept-Version` header in your requests:

```bash
curl -H "Accept-Version: v1" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.daytona.io/v1/build
```

## Migration Guides

When migrating between versions, refer to our migration guides:

- [v1 Migration Guide](/api/migrations/v1)
- [Upcoming Changes](/api/migrations/upcoming)

## Best Practices

1. **Specify Version Explicitly**: Always include the version in your API endpoint URLs
2. **Monitor Announcements**: Subscribe to our changelog for version updates
3. **Test in Staging**: Test version migrations in a staging environment first
4. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate your applications gradually when new versions are released
