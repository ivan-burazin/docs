The Daytona API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.daytona.io/v1
```

## Quick Start

1. [Get your API key](/api/authentication)
2. Make your first API request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.daytona.io/v1/build
```

## API Libraries

Official libraries for integrating with the Daytona API:

- [Python](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona-python)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona-node)
- [Go](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona-go)

## Making Requests

The API accepts requests with JSON-encoded bodies and returns JSON-encoded responses. All API endpoints expect requests to include the `Authorization` header with a valid API key.

### Request Headers

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Yes | Your API key in the format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` |
| `Content-Type` | Yes* | Set to `application/json` when sending JSON in the request body |

*Required only for requests with a body (POST, PUT, PATCH)

### Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. A typical successful response looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "type": "build",
    "attributes": {
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

Our API endpoints are organized around the main resources you'll be working with:

- [API Keys](/api/endpoints/apikeys) - Manage API authentication keys
- [Builds](/api/endpoints/builds) - Control build processes
- [Git Providers](/api/endpoints/git) - Configure and manage Git providers
- [Container Registry](/api/endpoints/registry) - Handle container registry operations

For detailed information about error handling, see our [Errors guide](/api/errors).
