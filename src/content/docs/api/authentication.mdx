The Daytona API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can manage your API keys through the API or CLI.

## API Keys

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Don't share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication is performed via the `Authorization` header with a bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.daytona.io/v1/build
```

## Managing API Keys

### Creating API Keys

You can create API keys using either the API or CLI:

#### Using the API
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.daytona.io/v1/apikey/my-key-name
```

#### Using the CLI
```bash
daytona apikey create my-key-name
```

### Listing API Keys

View all your active API keys:

#### Using the API
```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.daytona.io/v1/apikey
```

#### Using the CLI
```bash
daytona apikey list
```

### Revoking API Keys

Remove an API key when it's no longer needed:

#### Using the API
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.daytona.io/v1/apikey/my-key-name
```

#### Using the CLI
```bash
daytona apikey delete my-key-name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Keys Secure**: Never share your API keys or commit them to version control
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables rather than in your code
3. **Regular Rotation**: Periodically rotate your API keys to minimize security risks
4. **Least Privilege**: Create different API keys for different purposes to limit exposure

## API Key Limits

- Maximum of 10 active API keys per account
- Keys cannot be recovered once lost - create a new one if needed
- API key names must be unique within your account
